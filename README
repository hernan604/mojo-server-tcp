NAME
    Mojo::Server::TCP - Generic TCP server based on Mojo::Server::Prefork

SYNOPSIS
      use Mojo::Server::TCP;
      my $echo = Mojo::Server::TCP->new(listen => ['tcp//*:9000']);

      $echo->on(read => sub {
        my($echo, $stream, $chunk) = @_;
        $stream->write($chunk);
      });

      $echo->start;

DESCRIPTION
    Mojo::Server::TCP extends Mojo::Server::Prefork, so it has all the
    awesomeness you need for a full featured UNIX optimized TCP server.

    For better scalability (epoll, kqueue) and to provide IPv6 as well as
    TLS support, the optional modules EV, IO::Socket::IP and IO::Socket::SSL
    will be used automatically by Mojo::IOLoop if they are installed.

    See "DESCRIPTION" in Mojo::Server::TCP for more details.

ATTRIBUTES
  app
    Holds a Mojo object.

EVENTS
  read
      $self->read($stream, $chunk);

    Emitted when new data is received over the wire.
